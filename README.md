# mern-contact-keeper
This is a simple contact keeper app built from scratch using the MERN stack. It is a tutorial app from Brad Traversy's UDEMY course, [Modern React Front to Back](https://www.udemy.com/course/modern-react-front-to-back/). 

### Technologies and APIs Used

MongoDB Cloud Atlas - a NoSQL database storage solution

Node.js - a Javascript based runtime

Express - custom creation and serving of API endpoints

Axios - HTTP requests to custom API endpoints

Concurrently - a framework which allows a client side application (React) and a server side application (Node) to run in tandem with one another for development purposes. 

React/React-Router - a fully interactive front end designed to make use of hooks and context. Three separate React Contexts have been created for 
1. accessing the contacts API, 
2. the registration and authentication of users, and 
3. a system of alerts to notify the user when something has gone wrong. 

This has taught me a lot about how to create an app from scratch, and gave me a blank state to learn more about how to properly implement React hooks and context. 

### Instructions for Installation

Installing the application requires Node.js and Nodemon to be installed. 

The 'npm run dev' script will allow you to launch the server and client via Concurrently.
