# mern-contact-keeper
This is a simple contact keeper app built from scratch using the MERN stack. 

### Technologies and APIs Used

MongoDB Cloud Atlas - a NoSQL database storage solution
Express - custom creation of API endpoints
Axios - HTTP requests to custom API endpoints
Concurrently - a framework which allows a client side application (React) and a server side application (Node) to run in tandem with one another for development purposes. 
React/React-Router - a fully interactive front end designed to make use of hooks and context. Three separate React Contexts have been created for 1. accessing the contacts API, 2. the registration and authentication of users, and 3. a system of alerts to notify the user when something has gone wrong. 

This is a tutorial app from Brad Traversy's couse, [React Front to Back] (https://www.udemy.com/course/modern-react-front-to-back/).
